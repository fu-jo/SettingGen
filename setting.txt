The jungle is a hot and steamy world where enormous trees loom up to the sky, lush vegetation, ferns and fungi thrust up from the forest floor, and vines and lianas curl around the tall trunks, reaching eagerly towards the high canopy. Buttress and stilt roots sprawl across the shallow soil. Orchids burst into incredible swirls of colour and form, frogs and butterflies flaunt vibrant hues, emerald snakes glisten, parrots soar in a blaze of orange, scarlet, blue and green while hummingbirds probe exotic flowers for nectar. Toucans and birds of paradise add to this amazing colour spectrum. A myriad of plants and animals find their own special niche in this kaleidoscope of life and energy.
